We'd like to automatically segment these objects with high fidelity.

We're going to try to use <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron">Detectron</a> to do the heavy lifting for us!

## To do
1. Get <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron">Detectron</a> installed and running.
2. Try it on our dataset
